# foundationdb-simulation

This crate provides the tools to write Rust workloads that can be loaded and executed in the
official FoundationDB simulator, allowing for rigorous and deterministic testing of Rust layers.

## How It Works

FoundationDB's simulation framework includes an `ExternalWorkload` that can dynamically load a
shared object at runtime. This shared object must expose specific symbols that the simulator calls
to drive the workload.

Originally, `ExternalWorkload` used a C++ interface. This is cumbersome because the C++ ABI is not
stable and most languages do not interoperate with it easily. As of FoundationDB 7.4, the
`ExternalWorkload` supports a pure C interface, which this crate targets. For backwards
compatibility with FoundationDB 7.1 and 7.3, a C++ shim can be compiled to translate the C
interface back to the C++ one.

### For FoundationDB 7.4 and Newer (Recommended)

- Uses a pure C API (FFI-safe).
- **No need** to build inside the official FoundationDB Docker image.
- Requires setting `useCAPI=true` in the test configuration file.
- Results in faster build times and a simpler setup.

### For FoundationDB 7.1 and 7.3

- Requires a C++ shim to bridge the C and C++ ABIs.
- **Must** be built within the [official `foundationdb/build` Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/foundationdb/build)).
- The linker must be set to `clang`.
- Involves a more complex build process due to C++ ABI compatibility requirements.

## Setup

First, create a new Rust project with a library structure:

```console
.
├── Cargo.toml
└── src/
    └── lib.rs
```

Next, add `foundationdb-simulation` to your `Cargo.toml` and configure your crate as `cdylib`
as the `ExternalWorkload` expects a shared object.

```toml
[lib]
name = "myworkload"
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
# Make sure to select the feature flag for your target FDB version.
foundationdb-simulation = { version = "...", features = ["fdb-7_4"] } # or "fdb-7_1", "fdb-7_3"
```

## Compilation

If you are targeting FoundationDB 7.1 or 7.3 (which require the C++ shim), you **must** compile
your workload inside the official FoundationDB Docker image. Compiling outside of this environment
will almost certainly lead to segmentation faults at runtime due to C++ ABI mismatches.

Compile your workload using the standard Cargo commands. This will create a shared object in
`./target/release/` (`./target/debug/`). The filename will be `lib<name>.so`, where `<name>` is
the `name` you set in the `[lib]` section of your `Cargo.toml`. For example: `libmyworkload.so`.

## Launching the Simulation

The FoundationDB simulator is launched via the `fdbserver` binary with a TOML configuration file.

```bash
fdbserver -r simulation -f ./test_file.toml
```

Your test file must specify `testName=External` to use the `ExternalWorkload` framework.

```toml
testTitle = "MyRustTest"
testName = "External"

# The name passed to your workload factory
workloadName = "MyWorkload" 

# The path to the directory containing your .so file
libraryPath = "./target/release/" 
# The name of your library from Cargo.toml (without lib/.so)
libraryName = "myworkload" 

# Required for FDB 7.4+ when using the C API
useCAPI = true

# Custom options for your workload
myCustomOption = 42
```

## Workload Definition

FoundationDB workloads are defined by implementing the `RustWorkload` trait:

```rust
pub trait RustWorkload {
    async fn setup(&mut self, db: SimDatabase);
    async fn start(&mut self, db: SimDatabase);
    async fn check(&mut self, db: SimDatabase);
    fn get_metrics(&self, out: Metrics);
    fn get_check_timeout(&self) -> f64;
}
```

The simulator expects the shared object to expose a factory that can create workload instances.
This crate provides two traits to define these factories.

For simple use cases where a single workload implementation is defined, you can implement the
`SingleRustWorkload` trait directly on your `RustWorkload`.

```rust
pub trait SingleRustWorkload: RustWorkload {
    const FDB_API_VERSION: u32;
    fn new(name: String, context: WorkloadContext) -> Self;
}
```

Then, register your workload with the corresponding `register_workload` macro.

For more complex scenarios, where multiple workload implementations exist in a single shared
object, you can define a separate factory that implements the `RustWorkloadFactory` trait. This
allows selecting the implementation based on the workload name provided in the test configuration.

```rust
pub trait RustWorkloadFactory {
    const FDB_API_VERSION: u32;
    fn create(name: String, context: WorkloadContext) -> WrappedWorkload;
}
```

The factory must be registered with the corresponding `register_factory` macro.

> **Warning:** Do not use more than one "register macro" per project.

See the `atomic` and `noop` implementations in the `examples/` directory for complete working examples.

## The WorkloadContext

The `WorkloadContext` passed at instantiation is the primary way to interact with the simulator.
It provides several useful methods:

- `trace(severity, name, details)`: Add a log entry to the FDB trace files.
- `now()`: Get the current simulated time as a `f64`.
- `rnd()`: Get a deterministic 32-bit random number.
- `shared_random_number()`: Get a deterministic 64-bit random number (the same for all clients).
- `client_id()`: Get the ID of the current client.
- `client_count()`: Get the total number of clients in the simulation.
- `get_option<T>(name)`: Get a custom configuration option from the test file.

### Get options
In the simulation configuration file you can add custom parameters to your workload.
These parameters can be read with `WorkloadContext::get_option`. This method will first try to get
the parameter value as a raw string and then convert it in a the type of your choice.
If the parameter doesn't exist, its value is invalid or set to null, the function returns None.

Example:

```rust
impl SingleRustWorkload for MyWorkload {
    fn new(name: String, context: WorkloadContext) -> Self {
        let my_custom_option: usize = context
            .get_option("myCustomOption")
            .unwrap();
        Self { context, name, my_custom_option }
    }
}
```

### Tracing

Use `WorkloadContext::trace` to log messages with a given severity and a map of string "details".
A severity of `Severity::Error` will automatically stop the `fdbserver` process.

```rust
impl RustWorkload for MyWorkload {
    fn setup(&mut self, db: SimDatabase) {
        self.context.trace(
            Severity::Info,
            "SuccessfullySetupWorkload",
            details![
                "Layer" => "Rust",
                "Phase" => "setup",
                "Name" => self.name,
                "CustomOption" => self.my_custom_option,
            ],
        );
    }
    ...
}
```

### Randomness

To maintain determinism, all random numbers must be sourced from the simulator.
Use `WorkloadContext::rnd()` or `WorkloadContext::shared_random_number()` for a shared seed.
Do not use external entropy sources like `rand::thread_rng()`.

# Workload Lifecycle

## Instantiation

Once the `fdbserver` process is ready, it loads your shared object and calls your workload factory
to create instances. The simulator creates a random number of "clients," and your factory will be
called once for each client.

> **Note:** Contrary to the C++ `ExternalWorkload` which has separate `create` and `init` methods,
> the `RustWorkload` is not created until the simulator's `init` phase.

The `WorkloadContext` passed to your factory should be stored in your `RustWorkload`, as it is safe
to use across phases and will not be provided again.

## The setup, start, and check Phases

These three phases run sequentially. The simulation will not begin the `start` phase until all
clients have completed the `setup` phase, and so on.

Each function is `async` and runs cooperatively alonside the `fdbserver`.
As long as your function is executing, the `fdbserver` is paused to ensure determinism.
You **must** yield control back to the simulator for any database operations to occur.
Do not "busy wait" for a foundationdb function to return as it will deadlock.

FoundationDB Simulation runs your async code on a custom future executor that integrates with
the `fdbserver` event loop. It effectively turns your async fn into a sequence of cooperative
steps, allowing the `fdbserver` to drive simulation events between awaits.

- All foundationdb-rs async operations are compatible with this model.
- Avoid using arbitrary async primitives from other crates (e.g., `tokio::sleep`).

## Reporting Metrics

At the end of the simulation, the `get_metrics` method is called for each client.
Implement this method to report results.

```rust
fn get_metrics(&self, out: Metrics) {
    // val metrics are summed across all clients
    out.push(Metric::val("total_ops", self.ops as f64));
    // avg metrics are averaged across all clients
    out.push(Metric::avg("avg_latency", self.latency / self.ops.max(1) as f64));
}
```

# Common Mistakes

* **Compiling C++ shim outside of the Docker.** C++ ABI is extremely environment-dependent, not
  compiling in the exact same environment as the other half of the interface will probably result
  in segmentation faults or mangled strings that will trigger unrecoverable errors.

* **Forgetting to read all options.** Any custom option in the configuration that is not read will
  trigger a `Workload had invalid options.` error.

* **Forgetting useCAPI=true.** If the `fdbserver` used supports the C API, you still need to add
  explicitely this option, otherwise the `ExternalWorkload` will try to load the C++ symbol.

* **Using pointers or references after a phase ends.** After each phase, the simulator may move or
  deallocate memory. Any pointers or references to FoundationDB objects become invalid. You must
  use the fresh `&mut self` and `db` references passed to the next phase. Storing `SimDatabase`,
  `Transaction`, or `Future` objects across phases will lead to segmentation faults or other
  undefined behavior.

# Using External Async Runtimes (Tokio)

> generally **a bad idea**. It adds significant complexity and potential for subtle bugs.

FDB simulation workloads can integrate with external async runtimes like Tokio for
operations that require external libraries. Valid use cases include libraries that
internally use `tokio::spawn` for distributed/parallel execution, such as:

- Query engines (e.g., DataFusion) that parallelize execution via Tokio tasks
- gRPC clients that spawn background tasks for connection management
- HTTP clients with internal worker threads

## The Problem

FDB simulation uses a custom single-threaded executor. If you try to directly await
a Tokio task, the wake signal will come from a Tokio worker thread, violating the
single-threaded invariant and potentially causing undefined behavior.

```rust
// DON'T DO THIS - cross-thread wake violation!
async fn start(&mut self, _db: SimDatabase) {
    let handle = tokio::spawn(async { 42 });
    let _ = handle.await; // Wake comes from wrong thread!
}
```

## The Solution: `block_on_external`

Use `block_on_external` to safely await futures from external runtimes:

```rust
use foundationdb_simulation::block_on_external;

async fn start(&mut self, _db: SimDatabase) {
    let rt = get_runtime(); // Your Tokio runtime
    let _guard = rt.enter();

    let handle = tokio::spawn(async {
        // Runs on Tokio worker thread
        expensive_computation()
    });

    // Safely blocks FDB thread until Tokio task completes
    let result = block_on_external(handle).unwrap();
}
```

## Setting Up Tokio

Use a lazily-initialized static runtime:

```rust
use std::sync::OnceLock;
use tokio::runtime::Runtime;

static TOKIO_RUNTIME: OnceLock<Runtime> = OnceLock::new();

fn get_runtime() -> &'static Runtime {
    TOKIO_RUNTIME.get_or_init(|| {
        tokio::runtime::Builder::new_multi_thread()
            .worker_threads(2)
            .build()
            .expect("Failed to create Tokio runtime")
    })
}
```

## Caveats

- **Blocking**: `block_on_external` blocks the FDB simulation thread
- **No FDB operations**: Don't perform FDB operations inside Tokio tasks
- **Use sparingly**: Only for truly external work that cannot be adapted
- **Non-deterministic**: The Tokio portion is not simulation-deterministic

See the `tokio-compat` example for a complete working implementation.
