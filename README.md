The current version requires rustc 1.46+ to work.
The previous version (0.3) is still maintained and is available within the 0.3 branch.

You can access the `main` branch documentation [here](https://foundationdb-rs.github.io/foundationdb-rs/foundationdb/index.html).

## Supported platforms

Supported platforms are listed on the [foundationdb's README](foundationdb/README.md).

## Correctness

Special care has been set up to be sure that the crate is correct, like official bindings. Every hour, we are running thousands of seeds on the [BindingTester](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/blob/master/bindings/bindingtester/spec/bindingApiTester.md).
