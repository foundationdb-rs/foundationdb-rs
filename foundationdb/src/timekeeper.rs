//! There is a key range called TimeKeeper in the system key space which stores a rolling history window
//! of time to version mappings, with one data point every 10 seconds.
//! It is not exposed via any user-facing API, though of course the data can be read by a user.
//! It is not an official database feature and should not be relied on for anything where accuracy
//! is critical as nothing prevents or detects system clock skew on the FDB process logging these data points.
//!
//! TimeKeeper is used by backup and restore to convert timestamps to approximate versions and versions
//! to approximate timestamps to make reasoning about backup data and restore operations easier.
//! Lookups work by finding the nearest value for the query version or timestamp, taking the equivalent other value,
//! and then adding an adjustment estimate based on 1 million versions per 1 second.
//! This logic accounts for arbitrary version advancement due to recovery, DR switch operations, or any other reason.
